# MedicalPanelForDoctor
This repository contains the second application of the MedicalPanel project. In this case, it's a doctor's app that allows the doctor to end appointments, evaluate received photos sent by the patient, and more.
In the video below, you can see how these apps work and how they communicate with each other. On the left is the patient app and on the right is the doctor app.
